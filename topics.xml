    ARTGROUP PLANS
CHERRY PLANTING
Preliminaries for Beautifica
tion to Be Taken Up
at Meeting.
The Pine Arts Commission will
hold another meeting in about three
weeks, when it is expected that pre
liminary plans for the planting of
Japanese cherry trees in the Rock
Creek and Potomac Parkwaiy, on Co
lumbia Island and probably along
the Mount Vernon Memorial High
way, as well as along the Potomac
River in West and East Potomac
Parks, will be condsidered.
This was announced last evening
after the commission had considered
a variety of subjects of interest to
the National Capital. C. Marshall
Finnan, superintendent of the Na
tional Capital Parks and the branch'
of plans and design of the National
Park Service, will likely be asked by
the commission to submit plans for
the planting of thousands of Jap
anese cherry trees here.
Enhances Capital Beauty.
H. P. Caemmerer, executive secre
tary of the commission, declared his
organization considered the more ex
tensive use of Japanese cherry trees
and said that “the spreading of these
trees was thought very desirable by
the commission and would add beau
ty to the National Capital.” He said
this would tend to avoid the crowd
ing of 200,000 visitors in the Tidal
Basin area, creating unprecedented
traffic jams.
An objection lodged against the
Thomas Jefferson Memorial at the
Tidal Basin site is that practically
all the Japanese cherry tress would
be destroyed. Some observers see in
the Fine Arts Commission move for
additional cherry trees a determined
effort to dissipate this argument.
Both the National Capital Park and
Planning Commission and the Fine
Arts Commission have agreed to plac
ing the Thomas Jefferson Memorial
at the Tidel Basin site.
Other Trees and Shrubs.
Dr. Charles Moore, the chairman
of the Fine Arts Commission, has
advocated that not only Japanese
cherry trees but forsythia, wisteria,
magnolias, dogwood and other flow
ering trees and shrubs be planted to
“dress up the city.” The Japanese
cherry trees and others would be
planted under the program </text>

    <text>As Cherry Blossom Feature
Some of the major fountains In the
park system will be turned on as a
special feature of cherry blossom time
here.
Albert Clyde-Burton, assistant su
perintendent of the National Capital
Parks, today announced the cascades
In Meridian Hill Park will flow, and
the rainbow fountain at the Lincoln
Memorial reflecting pool and the
fountain at the pansy beds In West
Potomac Park also will be In opera
tion.
All these will play from 10 a m. to
5 p.m.. beginning Sunday. This pro
gram will continue dally through the
period in which the single bloesom
variety of Japanese cherry trees
around the Tidal Basin are In bloom.
The present outlook, with favorable
weather. Is that they will continue
until around April 10.
Today, despite a March chill, the
cherry blossoms were approaching
perfection. Many of the branches
have flowers In full bloom. The pink
and white blossoms were attracting
hundreds of visitors. Bus-loads of
sight-seers, going to and from the
Washington Monument, traveled near
the Tidal Basin to see the harbingers
of Spring.
The much publicized holly trees
that were planted, under a P. W. A.
program as a background for the
cherry trees were a disappointment
to observers. In many Instances, the
holly trees were not half as high as
the cherry trees themselves. It will
be many yean, officials concede, be
fore the holly trees are sufficiently
massive to form a- real verdant back
ground for the Oriental blooms and
make a display such as their sponsors
envisioned.
Train Schedules Revised.
Because the cherry trees this year
are blossoming sooner then originally
anticipated, train schedules for ex
cursions have had to be revised. Day
after tomorrow—Cherry Blossom Sun
day—is expected to bring a large con
course of people here from all sections
of the country.
Set apart in a warm spot near the
Library of Congress, authorities said
today a cherry tree is in bloom there
ahead of its fellows on the banks of
the Tidal Basin. Steam pipes run
ning between the Library and the
Capitol are credited with giving it an
advantage. The cherry tree in Mer
idian Hill Park is also far ahead of
its waterside kin, thanks to a southern
exposure and shelter from the north
wind.</text>

    <text>Cherry Trees Will Be Replanted
At Jefferson Memorial
Parks Officials Say Even More Will Replace
Those Destroyed for Shore Line Work
From the office of the National
Capital Parks came reassuring word
today concerning the famous Japa
nese cherry trees along the Tidal
Basin, some of which have been
sacrificed to permit realignment of
the shore line adjacent to the Jeffer
son Memorial.
Trees on the east side of the me
morial had to be sacrificed, parks
officials said, and new- trees, largely
Japanese cherry, wfc be replanted
as soon as excavation for the
changed shore line is completed,
the shoreline adjacent to the Jeffer
Officials expect the newly-planted
trees to bloom next spring.
When the shore line is finished and
a nwe sea wall is put in. there will
be more cherry trees than ever
before, parks officials said The
memorial will be set off by massed
cherry trees where a double line of
trees blossomed in the past.
For those who have wondered why
the destruction of trees has been
necessary, park officials gave this
explanation:
In order to have memorial face
north towards White House it had
to be built out of line with Tidal
Basin shore. Therefore it was
decided, when plans for the me
morial were made more than two
years ago to create a new shore line
to conform to the setting. This
necessitates excavating the shore
line to the east of the memorial
and filling in the cove on the west
side of the memorial.
The contractor is working under
a $245,000 contract which calls for
the excavation fill and sea wall
construction. The sea wall will
consist of 500 feet of cut granite
wall immediately in front of the
memorial and 1.600 feet of rough
j stone wall, like that already sur
rounding the basin, divided more
or less equally on both sides.
The Office of National Capital
Parks said yesterday that any fur
1 ther trees which had to be cut would
1 be removed in the daytime. It added
that virtually all the trees it was
necessary to remove had already
been removed.</text>

WASHINGTON, Oct. 18.—When tha

The shipment of the trees and the

Speaking of the gift of the emperor

	<text>The emperor of Japan Is sending to
New York also a large number of
cherry trees to be planted along River
side drive and Grant's tomb.
In Japan, the land of the cherry
blossom, there are many beautiful
legends about the trees and flower of
the cherry.
The blossom of the Japanese cherry
is of a peculiarly delicate beauty, and
there is a tradition in Japan that if
that same tone appears in the blos
soms of the Japanese cherry planted
in another country, that country can
he taken and subjugated by Japan.
Mr. Watase is authority for the
statement that while many Japanese
cherry trees have been brought to the
United States, the color of the bloa
eoms, although just as beautiful, is
unlike the blossom which appears in
Japan.</text>

    <text>Killing of Austrian
Heir Due to Plot
FRANCIS FERDINAND
HAD BEEN WARNED
Officially Informed of the Oan
gerous Nature of His
Visit to Bosnia.
S+ Sarajevo, Bosnia, June. 30.-
Martial law has been proclaim-
ed, both in the city and the
district of Sarajevo, in conse-
quence of the assassination of
S+ Archduke Franeis Ferdinand
and the Duchess of Hohen-
berg. +1
London, June 30.-Every dispatch
from Sarajevo and Vienna brought ad
ditional evidence that the assassina
tion of Archduke Francis Ferdinand
and the Duchess of Hohenberg was
one of the must carefully planned
crimes ever carried out against royal
ty.
Archduke Francis Ferdinand, it is
asserted, was well aware ,of the dan
ger he was running ddring his tour
of Bosnia, which he undertook as in
spector general of the forces of the
empire. This title was conferred up
on him last year by Emperor Francis
Joseph. His chief task was to in
spect the Austrian army, which guard
ed the Servian frontier during the re
cent Balkan wars and prevented any
encroach ients by Servian troops.
The Servian minister at Vienna told
Archduke Francis Ferdinand" of they
peril of his visit to Sarajevo at the
present time, and implored him even
if he insisted on going there himself
at least to leave tlhe duchess at home.
When the Duchess of Hohenberg
was Informed, however, of the dan
gerous nature of the journey the arch
dake was about to take, she skid her
place was at her husband's side.
lSgns of Hostility Shown.
When the archduke and the duchess
arrived at Sarajevo Saturday some
signs of hostility were shown by the
Serb population. Just before the cou
ple passed through the city the au
thorities succeeded in getting rid of I
a great display of Servian flags, which
the people had hoisted instead of fly
ing the Austrian colors.
The bitterness of feeling, however,
was carried to the extreme when at
a session of the Bosnian diet, called
to express sorrow at the death of the
archduke, four Servian deputies ap
peared in light suits in contrast to
the somber black of their fellow depu- I
ties.
The plans of the assassins contem
plated, it is said, the blowing up of
the royal train, when the archduke
and his wife were leaving Sarajevo, in
case the attempt by Gavrio Prinzip
failed. It is learned that several
bombs were found along the Sarajevo
railway over which the archduke and
his wife would have traveled.
DETAILS OF THE SLAYING
Was Second Attempt of the Day on
Lives of Victims.
Sarajevo, Bosnia, June 30.-A dou
ble tragedy was added to the long list
in the reign of Emperor Francis Jo
seph of Austria when Archduke Fran
cis Ferdinand, heir to the throne, and
his morganatic wife, the Duchess of
Hohenberg, fell dead under' a fusil
lade of bullets fired by Gavrio Prin
zip, an eighteen-year-old Servian stu
dent.
Archduke Ferdinand and his wife
left Vienna last Thursday for a tour
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They
were in the best of health and spirits.
The double murder occurred while
the royal party was motoring
through the streets of Sarajevo, the
Bosnia capital, after attending a re
oeption at the town hall.
It was the second attempt of the
day on the archduke's life, the first
occurring while he was going to the
reception, when Nedeljo .Gabrinovics,
twenty-one years old, hurled a bomb
filled with nails and tits of lead at
l the royal car. The archduke saw the
deadly missile coming through the
air and warded it off with his arm.
Archduke's Aids Are Wounded.
It exploded outside, slightly wound
ing aids-de-camp in a second car ans
a half dozen spectators. The duchess
tried to persuade her husband from
venturing in the car again, but M.
Potiorek, governor of Bosnia, reas
sured them with the remark:
"It's all over now. We have not

house to have been educated in the
public schools of Vienna, where he
mixed with pupils representing every
class of society.
He associated with working men
and tradespeople and joined them in
their games, thus getting into closer
touch with the aspirations and ideals
of the people than any of the other
Hapsburgs. He is a first lieutenant

The archduke gave what aid. he
could to the injured and ordered his
car to proceed.
When the burgomaster began his
customary address at the town hall
the archduke interrupted' sharply:
"Herr Burgomaster, we, have come
to pay you a visit .and bombs have
been thrown, at-us. This is altogether
an amazing. idigpity."
After a moment's pause he said:
"Now you may speak."
After leaving the hall the archduke
and duchess said the y wished to visit

sion 'of mercy when, at' Rudolph' and
Franz Josef streets, Prihzip began fir
ing.
The assassin had been carefully
coached in his part, but the presence
of the duchess in the carriage made
him hesitate momentarily.
Duchess Hit by First Bullet.
Then he fired. His bullet struck
the duchess. He fired again imme
diately and his second shot lodged in
the archduke's throat, severing the
jugular vein.
Herself almost unconscious, the
duchess, by superhuman endeavor,
raised the bleeding body of her royal
husband in her arms.
Her blood ran with his as she wept
and pleaded for his life not to pass
out with the bloody stream.
He died as she held him.
As his body stiffened the mortally
wounded wife fell on her knees pray
ing and herself died in this position.
The governor was in the car, but
escaped uninjured. He shouted to
the chauffeur to rush to the palace.
Physicians were in readiness there
but their services were useless. Both
the archduke and duchess died before
arriving.
The archduke died, as he probably
would have preferred to die, in the
arms of his wife-the wife whom he
married in the face of the strongest
opposition and who herself renounced
all claims to royalty.</text>

Franz Joseph, Just Recovering
From Illness, Hurries to
Dead Heir's Side.
Sarayevo, Bosnia, June 29 Martial
law was proclaimed today "both in the
city and the district of SarayeW in
consequence of the assassination here
i yesterday of Archduke FVancis Ferdl
'xi&amps;iidand the Duchcea of Hohentoeis.
Death maxira were taken of the ISvxa
j Archduke and the Ducheaa The bod
I lea of the two victims were then em
ilalme and placed on a califalque in
I the chapel of the palace, where they
were today surrounded by a magnifi
i cent display of wreaths and other
I floral ertfblems from all parts of the
country.
According to the serai-official re-
t port of the tragedy, at the time the"
fatal shots were, fired. Field Marshal
j Oskar Potiorek, governor of Bosnia,
was seated in the Archduke's motor
car. Count Francis Von Harrach was
t -t ci a i rt tr on tbe f ootbaard of the car
acting as. a. shield to the occupants,' of
urSom he had constituted himself the
special bodyguard after the bomb had
"been thrown a short time before by
NedeUq Qahrtnovics. The archduke J
I was Jokine with the Count about his
i precautions when the "reports of sew-
eraJ shots rang out.
The aim of the assassins was so
jtrue that each of the bullets inflicted
!sl mortal wound.
For am Instant after the attack F"ied
'Marshal Potiorek thought the Arch
duke and the Duchess, seated opposite
him. had again escaped. Neither the
Archduke nor tne oucneas utterea a
sound hut a moment afterward the
Wood spurted in great gushes from
the victims' mouths and throats a -rid
it was seen that they had 'been mortal-
ily wounded.
Iieotenant Colonel Erik Mortezi,
j who was wounded by the bomb in the
first was today pronounced out
j of dancer. The injury sustained 'by
I Count Von Boos-Waldeck was said to
pbe insignificant.
Servian Students Arrested.
Gabrlnovics, it was learned today,
"had. been expelled from Sarayevo- two
fyears ago but recently was permitted
to return through the intervention of
1 a Socialist member of the Bosnian
'Diet
Some Servian students here, when
Hhey heard the news of the assassina
tion, shouted:
"Thank God! We need not do It
ourselves."
They were arrested as accomplices
of the assassins.
Indications point to the tragedy
,havtng been engineered by persona
possessing more mature organizing
'ability than possessed by the youthful
assassins. It 1a generally thought in
'Austria and Hungary that the plot,
'ters had their headquarters in Bel
grade, the Servian capital.
Servian hatred of Austrian, which
always has been violent, has, it is
pointed out, recently been fomented
by, the newspapers in Belgrade and
by agitators throughout Servla and
Bosnia who have helped to Inflame
the minds. of the students and to in
duce them to sacrifice their lives in
the belief that they will go down- to
bietory as patriots.
Yesterday's 'crime seems likely to
have a contrary effect to that deired
by its authors for, even before the
bodies of the murdered couple have
been interred, the Austrian authori
ties already are contemplating severe
measures of punishment.
The Servian minister at Vienna told
Archduke Francis Ferdinand of the
peril of his visit to Sarayevo at the
present time and implored him, even
if he insisted on going there himself,
et least to leave the Duchess at home.
Dncfaess Knew of Danger.
When the Duchess of Hohenberg
was informed, however, of the dangw
ous nature of the Journey the Arch
duke was about to take she said her
place was at her husband's side. When
the Archduke and the Duchess ar
rived at Sarayevo on Saturday, some
signs of hostility were ehown by the
fterb portion of the population and,
only Just before the couple passed
through the city, the authorities suc
ceeded In getting rid of a great dis
play of Servian flags which the people
Isad hoisted instead of' flying the Aus
trian colors. The., bitterness of feel
ing, however, was carried! to the ex
1 reme when, at a cession of the Bos
i ton Diet called to express sorrow at
the death of the Archduke, four Ser
vian deputies appeared in light suits
in contrast to the sombre blade of
their fellow deputies.
The pians of the assassins contem
plated, it is said, the blowing up of
the royal train when the Archduke and
his wife were leaving Sarayevo in case
the attempt by Gavrio Frinzlp failed.
It was learned today that several
bombs had bae-n found along the Sar

Vienna. .Tune 28. The following de?
tails of the assassination of Archduke
Francis Ferdinand and his wife arc
now available. At 10 a. m. the arch?
duke, with the duchess, left the mili?
tary camp in an automobile for the
Town Hall. The car halted for some
minutes while a number of young
girls in festive attire greeted the heir
i.pparent and the duchess, who accept?
ed some flowers from them and spoke
a few kindly words.
The car moved on, but ?earctl'y had
it gone more than a few yards when a
man, who has since been identified as a
printer named Gabrlnovics, sprang out
from the crowd and hurled a bomb
full at the royal car. The archduke
himself warded it off w.th his arm
and it fell at the back of the car and.
rebounding on the roid, exploded.
The automobile had by this time
moved s?ve ?1 yari. and the full force
of the exp ision fell on the following
automobi.??, which contained four mem?
bers of the Archduke's suite. They
were Count Boos-Waldeck, Baron
Ilummerskireh, Countess von Lanjus,
lady in waiting, and Lieutenant Colo?
nel von Merizzi, aide-de-camp.
The last named received a splinter
in the neck and was badly hurt. The
royal chauffeur, at the direction of the
Archduke, immediately brought the
car to a standstill. In the mean time
the would-be assassin was seized by
the police, who 1k?1 the greatest diffi?

the crowd. The Archduke, after ascer?
taining the extent of the injuries to
his aide-de-camp and seeing that he
was being medically attended to, gave
the order to proceed, and the royal car
soon afterward arrived at the Town
Hall.
With his wife he spent half an hour
inspecting the Town Hall. The Arch?
duke then stated he was going to the
garrison hospital to see how Colonel
von Merizzi was progressing. Escorted
by the town councillors he descended
the step? leading to the entrance of
the buile g, re-entered the automo?
bile with his wife and drove off. The
car reached the corner of Franzjosef

close succession rang out.
The first struck the Archduke in the
right cheek, inflicting a fhortal wound,!
while the second penetrated the body j
of the Duchess, severing a main artery.
She sank unconscious into the arms of
her husband, who a few seconds after?

ASSASSINATION CAREFULLY PLANNED.
The assassination had been carefully planned. It was while
the? heir t? the Austrian throne and the woman he had loved so
well were on their way to the town hall that Nedeljo Gabrinovics,
a j ourneyman printer, slung a smoking bomb at the royal automo?
bil e. It was while they were returning from the hall, perhaps an
hour later, that Gavrio Prinzip, a high school student, stood at the
co rner of the Rudolfstrasse and poured his fusillade into the help
lesis couple. Again, an unexp.odcd bomb was found a few yards
aw fay from the scene of death. It had been flung in a corner by
an Dthsr madman after he had learned of the success of Prinzip's
attack.
ARCHDUKE WAS INDIGNANT.
After the bomb exploded the Archduke and the Duchess
pr oceeded to the City Hall. The automobiles were fleet and the
refws had not yet filtered through the crowd in waiting. Indeed,
th ere had hardly been time to telephone. So the burgomaster was
astonished when he met his royal guests at the door to have his
cu stomary address of greeting interrupted by the snapping words
of Francis Ferdinand:
"Herr burgomaster, we come to pay you a visit and bombs are
th rown at us. It is an insult!"
Then his princely dignity overcame his indignation, and he
pa used and said
"Now you may speak."
After the ceremonies the Archduke and his wife announced
th**at they would visit the wounded members of their suite in the
hcepitals on their way to the palace. They set out in their ?car,
th fcs time protected by a cordon of police. They drove rapidly

Ej-t Cable to The Ws -r Bcnld
Sarajevo, Bosnia, June 28. The Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir
to the throne of Austro-Hungary, and his morganatic Avife, the Duchess
of Hohenberg, were assassinated while driving through the streets of
this city this morning. They were shot to death after escaping a bomb
that was thrown at their motorcar and warded off by the archduke's
own arm.
They were on their way to a reception at the town hall when
the bomb was thrown. It did not explode until after the archduke's
car Tiad passed and the occupants of the next car, Count Boos Waldeck
and Col. Morizzi, the archduke's aid de camp were injured slightly.
Among the spectators six persons were more or less seriously hurt.
Trie perpetrator was a news
paper compositor named Cabrino-vitch from Trevinje.
Angered by Attack.
The archduke ordered his car halted,
but after he had found out what had
happened he continued on his way to the
town hall, where the councillors with the
mayor at their head awaited them. The
mayor was about to begin bis address of
welcome when the archduke Interrupted
him angrily saying:
"Herr Buergermelster. It Is perfectly
scandalous. We have come to Sarajevo
on a visit and a bomb has been thrown
at us."
The archduke paused for a moment and
then said:
"Now you can go on."
Thereupon the mayor delivered his address to the archduke who made a suit
able reply. The public which by this
time had heard of the bomb attempt,
burst into loud cries of "hurrah."
Miots Rlns list
After going around the town hall for
half an hour the archduke started for the
Garrison Hospital to visit Col. Mori-xl.
who had been taken there after the out
rage. As the archduke reached the corner of Rudolf street two pistol shots were
fired in rapid succession by a young man
named Gavro Prlnxlp. The first shot
struck the Duchess low down on the right
side, while the second hit the archduke
in the neck near the throat and pierced
the Jugular vein.
The duchess became unconscious immidiately and fell across the knee of ner
husband. The archduke also lost consciousness in a few seconds. The motor
car In which they were seated drove
straight to the palace, where army surgeons rendered first aid. but in vain.
Neither the archduke nor the duchess
gave any sign of life, and, the head of
the hospital could only cerUfy that both
were dead.
Frared Second Attack.
The authors of both attacks, who wer arrested promptly, are born Austrian-.
Cabrinovltch worked for a few weeks In
the government printing works at BU
grave. He returned to Sarajevo as a
Servian Chauvinist and made no conceal
ment of his sympathy with the king of
Servla. Both he and the actual murderer
expressed themselves to the police in
most cynical terms about their crimes.
It appears that after the first attempt
on their lives the duchess did not want
the archduke to enter the motercar
again, but the governor of Bosnia. M.
Potlorek. said: "It's all over now. We
haven't got more than one murderer In
Sarajevo."
At this the archduke decided to enter
the car again.
Before their departure from Vienna on
the Journey to Sarajevo the archduke
and duchess went to the chapel In the
palace and spent a long time In prayer.
Recently the archduke has declared
more than once his conviction that he
would not die a natural death.
The mayor of Sarajevo Issued a proclamation to Inhabitants denouncing the
crime and declaring that the confession
of the murderers proves beyond all
doubt that the bomb came from Belgrave f.
Darta from Behind House.
The youth Prlnxlp, who fired the fatal
shots. Is only nineteen. He fired at the
archduke's head and must have been well
Instructed, for he apparenUy was aware
of the well-guarred secret that the archduke always wore a coat of silk woven
obliquely, which no weapon or bullet
could pierce. This fabric Is used for automobile tires and Is puncture proof.
Later, details show that the assassin
darted from his hiding place behind a
house and actually got on the motorcar
In which the archduke and his wife were
sitting and took close aim. first at the
archduke and then at the duchess.

Vienna, June 29. Archduke Francis
Ferdinand, nephew of Emperor Fran
cis Joseph and heir to the Austrian
throne, and the Duchess of Hohen
berg, his morganatic wife, were assas
sinated at Sarajevo, the capital of
Bosnia.
Two attempts were made on the
lives of the royal party. A bomb was
thrown aet thir car, which was warded
off by the archduke, and his car pass
ed before It exploded under the next
car, which contained two of his aides
who were slightly Injured.
Later on a man, said to be a young
Servian student, fired two shots from
a revolver at the royal car and the
archduke and tho duchess were killed.
This adds another sad chapter to the
lrfo of tho aged Emperor Francis Jo-
soph during whose reign many grim
tragedies have occurred.
The Archduke Francis Ferdinand
and the Duchess of Hohenberg start
ed out In their auto to attend a recep
tion in their honor at tho town hall.
Suddenly a man named Cabrlnovlcs,
from Trebinje, who was standing
among tho crowd on the sidewalk
throw a bomb at the royal car with
good aim. The archduke saw it com
ing and warded it off with his arm
and tho bomb fell to the street and
did not explode until after the arch
duke's car had passed. When the ex
plosion occurred it resulted in the
wounding of Colonel Morlzzo, aid de
camp to the archduke, and Count Bozz
Waldlok, who occupied tho car Imme
diately behind that of the archduke.
Twenty-six persons among tho specta
tors were more or less seriously In
jured. Archduke Speaks.
The archduke immediately ordered
his chauffeur to stop the car. Ho made
inquiries as to what had happened and
gave orders to have tho Injured at
tended to. After this the procession
to the town hall was continued. Here
tho town councilors with the mayor at
tholr head were awaiting the royal
party to bid them welcome. The
royal party 'entered the hall and the
mayor was about to begin his address
when Archduke Francis Ferdinand In
terrupted him and In an angry man
ner said:
"Horr Burgomaster, it is perfectly
scandalous. Wo have come to Sara
jevo on a visit and a bomb is thrown
nt us." Here ho paused a moment and
then said; "Now you canvgo on." Tho
mayor then delivered his address and
the archduke made a suitable reply.
Couple Killed.
After making the rounds of the
town hall, which occupied half an
hour, the archduke and tho duchess

Pr.nzip, who was on the sidewalk,
fired two pistol shots In quick succes
sion at the archduke and the duchess
The man.Avhowas but a short distance
from the car, was a good marksman.
The first shot struck tho Duchess of
Hohenberg low down on the right
side, while the second bullet hit tho
archduke In the neck near the throat
and pierced the jugular vein.
The duchess became immediately
unconscious and fell across the knees
of her husband. The archduke lost
consciousness in a few seconds after
he. was hit. The chauffeur put on full
spce'd and rushed straight to the pal
ace, where an army of surgeons vain
ly tried first aid to the Injured.
Neither the archduke nor the duch
ess gave any sign of life and the only
tblug the head of the hospital could
do was to certify that both were dead.

Immediately after the assassination

Night to Answer and
Answer Right
Berlin, July 24. A "world war"
unless Servia complies with the de
mands Austria has mnde upon it, was.
boing predicted todny by diplomats and
military men here.
The Austrian ultimatum was a sequel
to the recent assassinntion of Archduke
Kraneis Ferdinand, Emperor Francis
Joseph's heir, by a Servian student at
Herajevo, Bosnia province.
It was freely asserted at the time
that the killing was the result of a
fot hntohed at Belgrade by a Pan
Hervian organization with extensive
ramifications in Austria, which has a
largo Servian population in its south
eastern provinces.
It was expected immediately after
the assassination that Austria would
demand an explanation from the Ser
vian government. It delayed so long,
however, that it began to be believed
the emperor was afraid he would preci
pitate a revolt of his own Servian sub
jects if he assumed a belligerent tone.
Late Thursday the Vienna foreign
office suddenly spoke. .Servia was
tilled on, not only to punish those con
concerned in the assassination plot
against Francis Ferdinand, but to sup
press at once the Pan-Servian move
ment. An answer was required by 6 p. m.

By Associated Press.
LIVERPOOL. April Two new
White Star liners which will be the
largest vessels yet projected will be
laid down at Belfast next June. The
exact measurements of the steamers
have not been given out/but they will
be over 840 feet In length, 78 feet in
breadth and with a gross tonnage of
45,000, or 50,000.
The ships are to be fitted with com
bination turbines and reciprocating
engines guaranteed to maintain a
speed of twenty-one knots. The names
of the vessels are to be Olympic and

j In the world are the Titanic and th« Olympic, of
the White Star Line, and within a year or two
I these leviathans will b« running between New Tori*
and Southampton.
Soon after the two fast Cunarders. too Lusl-
I taria and the Mauretania, had demonstrated that
I one could travel in luxury and at a very high
i speed through tha agency of turbine engines. th«
White Star X-in» announced that it would build
two steamers to beat the Oinarders la length and
breadth, and perhaps In other ways also. It was
reported at the tim» that th« new Whlta Star
liners would be a thousand feet in length, but sub
sequently it was officially announced that they
i would bo 900 feet lons, with a beam of ninety feet.
j When It was decided to build them it was found
that there was no gantry In thm world big enough
to accommodate such monsters, and It was then
that H&amp;rland Wolff began to rip up three of Its
largest gantries and build the hug* steel and con
crete cradle that Is now ready to bold th* Olympic
and the Titanic.
Before th* steel structure which supports th*
i powerful electric travailing cranes was erected a
big concrete base, twenty fret thick, was built upon
sp!le3 driven fifty fe«t into tha ground. The con
crete foundation, in addition to being more firm
than the regular earthen base, has the advantage
of cleanliness, an 1 tools and materials which mar
fall from the cranes la the course of construction
may be found more readily. Parts of deck fittings
end tools have fallen into the ground la gantries
with earth bases and have not been recovered
until the vessel has gilded from Its cradle into the
water.
The construction of the Olympic has been started.
The keel of the Titanic will be laid soon, and
visitors to the shipyards at Belfast will have an
opportunity of seeing the simultaneous csnstrcs
tion. side by side, of the largest two steamers tn
the world. The gantries are so built that any
piece of material, however heavy or awkward, may
be placed and held In whatever position the con
atructora desire. The gantries themselves are more
than a thousand feet in length. 3C3 feet high and
something more than two hundred feet la -Ki&amp;X

    <text>Star line's twin sea giants Olympla and
Titanic are under construction. Mod
ern methods h;ive eliminated practic
ally all the noise, especially that of
tlie riveting process, as the large plates
comprising the sijes of these sea mon
sters are bt;in clamped by a new
hydraulic system.
The Olympic's plating is finished
and her huge hull overtowers that
of the Titanic the plating of which
I nearly two-thir&amp;3 completed.
These massive ships are 860 feet
long and 45.000 register, which means
thru they exceed all others now afloat
by 70 feet in length and by 13,000
tons measurement. It is estimated
that their dead weight at launching
time will be between 25,000 and 30,
000 t"iis; while their total displace
ment when fully equipped is calcu
lated to be more than 60.000 tons.
The largest single plates, of steel
employed on the ships measure 36
ftet and weight 4 1-2 tons, and the
largest single beam, supporting the
decks, measures 92 feet and tops 4
tens. The giant rudder which will be
easily controlled by a specially de
signed electric motor, weighs 100
tons.
The White Star line has intimated
accommodations
on the Olympic and Titanic will afford
every comfort and luxury.
The Olympic which will be launch
ed on October 20th next, will enter
the Atlantic trade In the summer of
1911, and the Titanic, due to leave</text>

    <text>BIGGEST OF ALL
OCEAN LINERS,
Gigantic S1is to Jo n the At
lanid, Fleet.
EACH CARRYING 5,000 PEOPLE
Olympic and Titanic Will Be 860 Feet
Long, Seventy Feet Longer Than Any
Ship Afloat-To Have All the Splen
dors of a Great Hotel and a Big Salt
Water Swimming Bath.
Near: the end of the year 1911 there
vill cross the Atlantic ocean the great
est steamship that ever drove past
,tandy IIOok 0c its way to New York
:l vense th!m excuedls by seventy feet
the length of the giant Cunarders, the
Lusitania and Mauretania. When these
great vessels camne out many of those
who looked at the majestic sisters felt
sure that in these two the last word in
marine construction had been reached.
But the Olympic, now under con
struction at Belfast. Ireland, for the
White Star line, exceeds these two in
size by almost as great a margin as
the Lusitania and Mauretania exceed
the older Lucanla and Campania. The
newer Cunarders are 790 feet in length.
The length of the White Star giantess
is 860 feet. The Cunarders have a
beam of 88 feet; that of the Olympic
is 92 feet. In displacement the new
vessel exceeds the older ones by 3,000
tons. She will not be endowed with
the high speed of the ocean grey
hounds.
Titanic, a sister vessel to the Olym
pic, is also under construction at Bel
fast, but the work upon this other
vessel is not as far advanced as it
is on the Olympic. Each ship will
have accommodations for 5,000 pas
sengers and for a crew of 600.
Each vessel will have nine steel decks,
and on the upper of these there will
be a spacious entrance hall, dining
saloons, smoking rooms, libraries, wo
men's parlors or drawing rooms, grill,
lounge rooms and restaurants as well
as a main saloon about ninety feet
wide.
Skating Rink on Upper Deck.
One of the upper decks is to be com
pletely inclosed to serve as a ballroom
or skating rink. Instead of canvas
partitions or awnings to keep out the
wind and rain the whole will be in
closed with glass windows similar to
those in railway carriages. By day
this spacious apartment may be used
as a sun parlor or promenade, and it
will be large enough to enable several
hundred passengers to move about
with ease and comfort.
In addition to extended suits of
rooms complete flats will be available.
thus making it possible to cross the
Atlantic In the enjoyment of all the
privacy of one's own home. Ocean
going fiats will comprise bedrooms,
sitting rooms, private bathrooms and
even a jprivate library. all en suite.
Cabins with private shower baths at
tached, a great salt water swimming
bath large enough to permit of diving
and a well equipped gymnasium are to
be among the features which will be
Introduced.
Veranda Cafe on Board.
The main dining saloon will be fur
nished to seat 600 persons at once,
and should a guest tire of this grand
chamber he can wander from one cafe
to another--each day have his meals
in a different aparinient. The veranda
cafe will also be a leading feature of
these ships. It will be placed on one
of the upper decks far astern, fully
fifty feet above the sea level, and as it
will be constructed with exposed raft
ers intwined with vines and creeping
plants and have latticed sides, it will
make the illusion of a cafe at the sea
side almost perfect.
Precautions Again t Danger.
Each steamer will be divided into
upward of thirty steel compartments
separated by heavy bulkheads. An
automatic device on the bridge will
control all these heavy steel doors,
making it possible for a single hand to
close them all in almost an instant in
case of danger. Each of these doors
will be electrically connected with a
chart on the bridge, where each door
will be represented by a small electric
light, and when one of these doors
closes the light will burn red, but
while it remains open the disk will be
quite dark. The officer on the bridge
will thus be able to see at a glance
whether or not all the compartments
have been closed.
Yet another set of safety devices will
guard against tire in any portion of
the vessel. A series of thermostats
will be scattered throughout the great
framework, so arranged as to indicate
a rise in the tempetrature above a cer
tain point. Should the' temperature
reach the danger point, the fact will
be immediately commnunn ated to the
oilcer on the bridge by the ringing
of an electric bell, while an electric
light on a great chart on the wall will
brP red.
,T vessels will be of the triple
'serw type and are designed for a
So t 21 knots an hour. Each ship
I.wl have three propellers, and. like the
~Cardsei. will carry four funsels
pole ventiltatr mmats.
